# 🔍 Findr – AI-Powered Hackathon Team Formation

**Findr** is a smart matchmaking platform built for hackers, by hackers. Whether you're looking to form the perfect team before a hackathon or discover last-minute teammates who complement your skills, Findr uses AI to help you build, match, and win.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. 🧠 AI-Enhanced User Profiles  
Users create a profile by entering:
- Skills  
- Experience level  
- Hackathon interests  
- Availability  

AI then auto-generates a compelling profile summary, helping users stand out and making them easier to discover by potential teammates.

### 2. 🤝 Smart Matching & Swiping  
- **Swipe right** to match with potential teammates  
- **Swipe left** to pass  
- Once matched with **2+ users**, you can form a team

You can also skip swiping entirely and let AI handle team formation based on skills, balance, and availability.

- Receive **role recommendations** (e.g., backend, frontend, PM)
